I am a dedicated and motivated web developer whom last August, decided to make a pivotal decision to transition industries and delve into the realm of programming. As an audio engineer, I found fulfillment in problem-solving and collaborating with clients to transform creative concepts into tangible outcomes. Programming was a natural progression for me. Since then, I have dedicated myself to a variety of learning materials. 

Although my journey into the world of coding may be in its early stages and my professional background may not yet reflect experience in developing, I bring to the table a wealth of transferable skills cultivated through my extensive involvement in music and technology. My tenure in the music industry has honed my ability to adapt to dynamic environments, collaborate effectively with diverse teams, and approach challenges with creativity and resilience – qualities that I am eager to leverage in my transition into the realm of coding.

Proficient in C, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JQuery, Python, and React, and equipped with a foundational understanding of SQL, and ofcourse, an infinite knowledge of all things audio.
